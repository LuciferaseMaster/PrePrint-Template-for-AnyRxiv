# Vector logos for #preprints

If you are making a #preprint, why not do it [with style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEFlrd4buE4&t=414s)!

[Nice vector logotypes](/preprint_logos/svg_files) in the SVG format, which can be inserted into your manuscript file to mark it as a preprint: a general one, and the ones aimed for bioRχiv (bioRxiv) or medRχiv (medRxiv). See some of them presented and compared [on a Letter-size page in PDF](/preprint_logos/preprint_logos_presented.pdf) (or this document saved as [PNG](/preprint_logos/preprint_logos_presented.png) and [JPG](/preprint_logos/preprint_logos_presented.jpg)).

Below, are examples (four combined pages) how these logos can be placed in the standard manuscript file (A4 or Letter size).<br> 
The individual pages can be seen [here](/preprint_logos/page_examples/).

1) The first logo signifies a preprint status of the manuscript document. I've designed it to be visually nice and to reflect different types of preprinted research. It's also supposed to reflect different layers and meaninings of the concept of preprints and open science.
See for yourself!

No tagline: &nbsp;&nbsp;

3) The [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) and [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) repositiories (now a part of [openRxiv](https://www.cshl.edu/the-natural-evolution-of-biorxiv-and-medrxiv/)) only have the png-format logos available, which are raster (pixel) images. This is in contrast to, for example, [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/public-dashboard), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/), and [EarthArchive](https://eartharxiv.github.io/resources.html), which have vector (svg) logos available.

a) Therefore, I have generated the same logos in the vector format. They can be stretched or compressed without any loss of quality and detail.

b) However, these logos are originally made with [three propriatory fonts](http://disq.us/p/32uc0ua), not readily available to most people. 

So, I think it's nice — and more in line with the open science spirit — to have these logos made with free fonts. This would also give an easy option to simply type them inside your document, using the appropriate fonts.

Therefore, I have played around a little and made two versions with a very similar vibe by using the following free fonts: [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/) Medium, Palatino Linotype, [Coconat](https://www.collletttivo.it/typefaces/coconat) Regular & Demi (for the main logotype word), and [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) Medium (Small Caps — for the tagline). These fonts are open source fonts, except for [Palatino Linotype](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/palatino-linotype) (for the "χ" letter) which is [included](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/palatino-linotype) with every MS Windows OS and with MS Office.

Free-fonts-versions of the BioRxiv logo: style1 and style2.

A free-fonts-version of the logos of medRxiv and openRxiv (style1):

3) I have attached the two most popular preprint templates [MS Word format] (from [here](https://github.com/finkelsteinlab/BioRxiv-Template) and [here](https://github.com/chrelli/bioRxiv-word-template)) with the logos inserted and other slight modifications, to provide a better reading experience: [template1](/preprint_logos/preprint_BioRxiv_Template_MS-Word_Finkelstein_ver-mv1.docx) and [template2](/preprint_logos/preprint_BioRxiv_Template_MS-Word_Ebbesen_ver-mv1.docx).

4) I think it is also nice to include the actual text of the logo as a small text box — invisible, behind the logo itself. This way this text is still present in the final PDF file despite the logo being just a vector image.

More updates to follow.
