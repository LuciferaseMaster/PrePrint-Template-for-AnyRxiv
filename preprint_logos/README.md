# Logos for #preprints
Nice vector logos which can be inserted into your the manuscript file to mark it as a preprint: a general one, the ones aimed for bioRχiv (bioRxiv) or medRχiv (medRxiv).

1) The first logo signifies a preprint status of the manuscript. I've designed it to be visually nice and to reflect different types of preprinted research, and different layers and meanining of this concept.
See for yourself!

2) The [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) and [MedRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) repositiories only have the png-format logos available, unlike [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/public-dashboard) and [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/), for example.

a) I have made the same logos in a vector format.

b) However, these logos are originally made with [three propriatory fonts](http://disq.us/p/32uc0ua), not readily available to most people. 
So, I think it's nice — and more in line with the open science spirit — to have these logos made with free fonts. 
Therefore, I have made two versions with a very similar wide by using the following free fonts: EB Garamond Medium, Palatino Linotype, Coconat Demi and Fira Sans Medium (Small Caps). These fonts are open source fonts, except for [Palatino Linotype](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/palatino-linotype) (for the "χ" letter) with is [included}(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/palatino-linotype) with every MS Windows OS.

3) I have attached the two most popular preprint templates (from [here](https://github.com/finkelsteinlab/BioRxiv-Template) and [here](https://github.com/chrelli/bioRxiv-word-template)) with the logos inserted and other slight modifications, to provide a better reading experience.

4) I think it is also nice to include the actual text of the logo as a small text box  — invisible, behind the logo itself. This way this text is still present in the final PDF file despite the logo being just a vector image.

More updates to follow.
