# Vector logos for #preprints
[Nice vector logotypes](/preprint_logos/svg_files) in the SVG format, which can be inserted into your manuscript file to mark it as a preprint: a general one, and the ones aimed for bioRχiv (bioRxiv) or medRχiv (medRxiv). See some of them presented and compared [on the Letter-size page in PDF](/preprint_logos_presented.pdf).

1) The first logo signifies a preprint status of the manuscript document. I've designed it to be visually nice and to reflect different types of preprinted research, and different layers and meanining of this concept.
See for yourself!

3) The [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) and [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) repositiories (now a part of [openRxiv](https://www.cshl.edu/the-natural-evolution-of-biorxiv-and-medrxiv/)) only have the png-format logos available, unlike [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/public-dashboard) and [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/), for example.

a) I have made the same logos in the vector format. They can be stretched or compressed without any loss of quality and detail.

b) However, these logos are originally made with [three propriatory fonts](http://disq.us/p/32uc0ua), not readily available to most people. 
So, I think it's nice — and more in line with the open science spirit — to have these logos made with free fonts. 
Therefore, I have played around a little and made two versions with a very similar vibe by using the following free fonts: [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/) Medium, Palatino Linotype, [Coconat](https://www.collletttivo.it/typefaces/coconat) Demi (for the main logotype word), and [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) Medium (Small Caps — for the tagline). These fonts are open source fonts, except for [Palatino Linotype](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/palatino-linotype) (for the "χ" letter) which is [included](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/palatino-linotype) with every MS Windows OS and with MS Office.

Free-fonts-versions of BioRxiv logo: style1 and style2.

A free-fonts-version logo of medRxiv and for openRxiv (style1):

More updates to follow:

3) I have attached the two most popular preprint templates (from [here](https://github.com/finkelsteinlab/BioRxiv-Template) and [here](https://github.com/chrelli/bioRxiv-word-template)) with the logos inserted and other slight modifications, to provide a better reading experience.

4) I think it is also nice to include the actual text of the logo as a small text box — invisible, behind the logo itself. This way this text is still present in the final PDF file despite the logo being just a vector image.

More updates to follow.
