# BioRxiv-Template
MS Word templates for a more readable BioRxiv product

This  template project is an attempt to easily place BioRxiv preprints in a more reader-friendly format.
Inspiration for this format comes from a similar product by Dr. Dennis Eckmeier (http://www.eckmeier.de/?attachment_id=340)

You can either:
1. Cut and paste into the .docx file, which is recommentded if the source document is not already formatted using MS Word styles)
OR
2. Apply the .dotx template to the source document, if it is already formatted using MS Word styles.
